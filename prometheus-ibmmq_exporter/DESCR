# mq-metric-samples

This repository contains a collection of IBM® MQ sample clients that utilize
the [IBM® MQ golang metric packages](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-golang)
to provide a program that can be used with existing monitoring technologies
such as Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch, etc.

## Health Warning

This package is provided as-is with no guarantees of support or updates.
There are also no guarantees of compatibility with any future versions of the package;
interfaces and functions are subject to change based on any feedback.

These programs use a specific version of the `mqmetric` and `ibmmq` golang packages.
Those packages are in the [mq-golang repository](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-golang)
and are also included in the `vendor` tree of this repository.
